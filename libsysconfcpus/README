DESCRIPTION
-----------

libsysconfcpus is an $LD_PRELOAD library that intercepts calls to sysconf(),
and adjusts the responses for _SC_NPROCESSORS_CONF and _SC_NPROCESSORS_ONLN,
which are used to determine the number of processors available (either
configured or online) at runtime in a system.  Unfortunately, some closed-
source software assumes that all of these processors may be used for
computation, which is an assumption that is frequently not true on multiuser
and HPC systems.  Thus, libsysconfcpus provides a simple, non-intrusive way of
adjusting the behaviour of such software (when it is dynamically linked).

In addition, libsysconfcpus is a small, simple example of how to use
$LD_PRELOAD to do function call interception on glibc and POSIX systems.  It is
hoped that it is useful not only inherently, but also for learning about
$LD_PRELOAD, and as a template or skeleton LD_PRELOAD library.  Its
from-scratch development was used to illustrate LD_PRELOAD usage in the "Fun
with LD_PRELOAD" presentation by the author at linux.conf.au 2009 in Hobart.


INSTALLATION
------------

Standard autoconf process:  ./configure && make && make install


USAGE
-----

    sysconfcpus [options] <program> [args...]

Valid options are:

    -v, --version   Display the sysconfcpus version
    -h, --help      Display this help
    -d, --debug     Display debug info

    -n, --num <n>   Number of processors (both conf and onln)
    -c, --conf <n>  Number of processors (conf(igured))
    -o, --onln <n>  Number of processors (online)


EXAMPLEs
--------

$ test-sysconfcpus 
sysconf(_SC_NPROCESSORS_CONF) = 2
sysconf(_SC_NPROCESSORS_ONLN) = 2
$ sysconfcpus -n 8 test-sysconfcpus 
sysconf(_SC_NPROCESSORS_CONF) = 8
sysconf(_SC_NPROCESSORS_ONLN) = 8
$ sysconfcpus -c 8 -o 6 test-sysconfcpus 
sysconf(_SC_NPROCESSORS_CONF) = 8
sysconf(_SC_NPROCESSORS_ONLN) = 6
